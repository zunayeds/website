- Collaborated with a team to enhance the existing Clinical Outcome Assessment System using Angular 9, .NET Core 3.1, SQL Server 2018, Xamarin Forms, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Table Storage, and AWS S3 Storage.
  Also enhanced the legacy system using AngularJS, .NET Framework 4.5, and Windows Forms.
- Created an Angular Library based on a JavaScript Library for scheduling Clinical Trial workflow by connecting nodes.
  Also enhanced the base library to support programmatic node creation, deletion, and cloning besides default drag and drop.
  The new library could be consumed in any Angular project and could render any Angular components as nodes.
- Guided and mentored a small group of novice software engineers for a brief duration and successfully developed 60% of the Angular library within the designated timeline under heavy work pressure.
- Captured client business requirements and conducted demo sessions in the absence of the Team Lead.
